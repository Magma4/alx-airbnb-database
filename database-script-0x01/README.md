Key Components and Relationships
To effectively manage this platform, you'll need to keep track of:

Users:
    Each user has a unique ID.
    Information like name, email, and password is stored.

Properties:
    Each property has a unique ID.
    Information like name, description, location, and price per night is stored.
    Each property is owned by a specific user.

Bookings:
    Each booking has a unique ID.
    Information like check-in date, check-out date, and the associated user and property IDs is stored.

Payments:
    Each payment has a unique ID.
    Information like the amount, payment method, and the associated booking ID is stored.

Reviews:
    Each review has a unique ID.
    Information like the rating, comment, user ID (who wrote the review), and property ID (which property was reviewed) is stored.

Messages:
    Each message has a unique ID.
    Information like the sender's ID, the recipient's ID, the message content, and the timestamp is stored.


Ensuring Data Integrity:
    To ensure the accuracy and consistency of this data, we use database design techniques:

        Primary Keys: Each table has a unique identifier (like a social security number) for each record.
        Foreign Keys: These link related tables together. For example, a booking record might reference the user who made the booking and the property that was booked.
        Constraints: These are rules that ensure data quality. For example, a user's email address must be unique, and a review rating must be between 1 and 5.
        Indexes: These are like an index in a book. They speed up searches by creating a shortcut to specific data.
